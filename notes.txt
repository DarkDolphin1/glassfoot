behaviour for SEND and READ

while sending a key , the sender follows the following format 
SEND.(base):(key)

as an example , 
    SEND.HEX:0123456789abcdef
or  SEND.DEC:0123456789123456

as a reader , you should always assume that encountring a SEND means read.
before you read the key , before the key is even printed , you should send a request using READ

for sender :
    use SEND when sending the key , only after encountring READ 

for receiver :
    use READ when requesting the key , and wait for SEND

void wait(target) => waits for an incoming message
void ask(base) => asks the other side to send their PublicKey in given base

void transfer(keys , base , op) => prints the PublicKey in given base
example :  SEND.HEX:0123456789abcdef

void readKey(&key) => reads the key from stdin , formats it and stores it in key.B_PublicKey

void notify(bool success) => informs the sender that key was received successfully or not
